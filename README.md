## Application using Selenium Webdriver and TestNG
- Three different web sites are connected by using WebDriver and obtained the price of the same product which is the iPhone and wrote a simple report comparing their prices. The cheapest, the average price and the most expensive one. Drivers folders to keep the Chrome and Firefox driver exeâ€™s there. The program starts by using ChromeDriver to navigate to websites to fetch the prices of the desired product.

- The program includes four test methods to verify various login scenarios: a valid login, an invalid login with both incorrect username and password, an invalid login with a correct username but incorrect password, and an invalid login with an incorrect username but correct password.

- Selenium TestNG framework-based test suite designed to verify the login functionality of a web application hosted at "https://practice.expandtesting.com/login". The test suite includes a FactoryTest class that handles the login operations and a nested TestFactory class to provide different sets of credentials for testing. The credentials are passed to the test class via a factory pattern, which allows the same test to be run with multiple sets of data.
